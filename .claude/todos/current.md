## 📋 PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Implement OpenPhone webhook receiver with queue
   - Why: Core functionality for receiving SMS
   - Depends on: Database schema
   
3. [ ] Configure Celery with Redis for async processing
   - Why: Background task processing for campaign sending
   - Depends on: Basic app structure

## 🔍 RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Set up PostgreSQL schema with Alembic
- **File**: backend/app/models/ and alembic/ directories
- **Problem**: Need database schema, models, and migration system for data persistence
- **Solution**: Set up Alembic migrations, create base models for campaigns, contacts, messages

### Key Decisions This Session
- 10:05 AM: Decided to exclude ngrok from v2 Docker setup (learned from v1 complexity)
- 10:20 AM: Chose Python 3.11 for better async performance
- 10:25 AM: Used multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing
- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI structure at 85.5% test coverage - identified TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: FIXED critical TDD violation - achieved 100% test pass rate
- 11:47 AM: Implemented test enforcement system to prevent future violations
- 11:47 AM: Enhanced CLAUDE.md to require 100% test pass rate for completion

### Files Created/Modified This Session
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main container orchestration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Python 3.11 FastAPI container  
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Node 20 SvelteKit container
- `backend/entrypoint.sh` - FastAPI startup script
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `frontend/package.json` - Node dependencies and scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.env.local` - Local development config
- `.gitignore` - Project exclusions

- `.claude/hooks/enforce-tests-pass.sh` - Test enforcement system preventing <100% pass rate
- `CLAUDE.md` - Enhanced with mandatory 100% test pass requirement

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Start the complete development environment:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running:
docker-compose ps

# Run full test suite (must be 100%):
docker-compose exec backend pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Continue with database setup:
docker-compose exec backend alembic init alembic
```

## 🎯 Definition of Done for Current Task (PostgreSQL Schema)
- [ ] Alembic initialized with proper configuration
- [ ] Base models created: User, Campaign, Contact, Message, MessageLog
- [ ] Database connection working in FastAPI app
- [ ] Migration files generated and applied
- [ ] Repository pattern implemented for data access
- [ ] Tests for database models and repositories
- [ ] All database operations working via Docker PostgreSQL

## 📝 Session Notes

- 10:30 AM: v1 analysis showed ngrok caused complexity - v2 will use cleaner webhook approach
- 11:00 AM: All foundation files created, ready for application structure phase
- 11:12 AM: Starting FastAPI application structure - following TDD principles with clean architecture
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI foundation at 85.5% test coverage - identified major TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT - Fixed TDD violation, achieved 100% test pass rate

- 11:47 AM: FastAPI foundation truly complete and TDD-compliant - ready for database layer

## ⚠️ Blockers & Issues
*No active blockers - Docker environment setup complete*

## 🔜 Next Session Priority
With FastAPI foundation 100% complete:
1. Set up PostgreSQL schema with Alembic migrations (IN PROGRESS)
2. Create database models for campaigns, contacts, messages
3. Implement repository pattern for data access
4. Add comprehensive database tests

## 🏆 Major Achievement This Session
**FIXED CRITICAL TDD VIOLATION**: Went from 85.5% to 100% test pass rate
- Test enforcement system now prevents task completion with <100% pass rate
- FastAPI foundation is truly complete and TDD-compliant
- All future development will maintain 100% test compliance
