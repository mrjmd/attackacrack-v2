## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Set up PostgreSQL schema with Alembic
   - Why: Database migrations and schema management
   - Depends on: FastAPI structure
   
2. [ ] Implement OpenPhone webhook receiver with queue
   - Why: Core functionality for receiving SMS
   - Depends on: Database schema
   
3. [ ] Configure Celery with Redis for async processing
   - Why: Background task processing for campaign sending
   - Depends on: Basic app structure

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Initialize FastAPI project structure
- **File**: backend/app/ (creating directory structure)
- **Problem**: Need proper FastAPI application structure with models, services, API layers
- **Solution**: Create modular FastAPI app following clean architecture patterns

### Key Decisions This Session
- 10:05 AM: Decided to exclude ngrok from v2 Docker setup (learned from v1 complexity)
- 10:20 AM: Chose Python 3.11 for better async performance
- 10:25 AM: Used multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing
- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation

### Files Created/Modified This Session
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main container orchestration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Python 3.11 FastAPI container  
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Node 20 SvelteKit container
- `backend/entrypoint.sh` - FastAPI startup script
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `frontend/package.json` - Node dependencies and scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.env.local` - Local development config
- `.gitignore` - Project exclusions
- `.claude/hooks/persist-todos.sh` - Todo persistence automation

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Start the complete development environment:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running:
docker-compose ps

# View logs if needed:
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Task (FastAPI Structure)
- [ ] FastAPI app created with proper structure (backend/app/main.py)
- [ ] Directory structure: models/, services/, api/, core/, schemas/
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint working
- [ ] Database connection configured
- [ ] Test structure in place (tests/ with unit/, integration/, e2e/)
- [ ] All services accessible via Docker
- [ ] Tests written first and passing

## üìù Session Notes
- 10:05 AM: Docker environment phase represents major milestone - full containerized development ready
- 10:30 AM: v1 analysis showed ngrok caused complexity - v2 will use cleaner webhook approach
- 11:00 AM: All foundation files created, ready for application structure phase
- 11:12 AM: Starting FastAPI application structure - following TDD principles with clean architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues
*No active blockers - Docker environment setup complete*

## üîú Next Session Priority
After Docker environment verification:
1. Use fastapi-implementation agent to create FastAPI app structure
2. Set up database models and Alembic migrations  
3. Create basic webhook endpoint for OpenPhone
4. Add Celery task configuration
