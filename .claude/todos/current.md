## 📋 PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Implement contact management API endpoints
   - Why: Core MVP feature for managing SMS recipients
   
2. [ ] Implement message history and status tracking endpoints  
   - Why: Need visibility into sent messages and delivery status
   
3. [ ] Add frontend campaign management UI with SvelteKit
   - Why: Users need interface to create and manage campaigns
   
4. [ ] Implement CSV import functionality with validation
   - Why: Bulk contact import is essential for campaigns
   
5. [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
   - Why: Production readiness requires proper error handling

## 🔍 RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Status**: Test suite complete, ready for next features
- **Achievement**: 100% test pass rate achieved (280/280 tests)
- **Next**: Implement remaining MVP features

### Key Decisions This Session
- Used proper agent workflow (Task tool) for all fixes
- Fixed authentication by ensuring test users persist across sessions
- Converted integration tests to use API calls instead of direct DB operations
