# Attack-a-Crack v2 - Current Session TODOs
*Last updated: Sun Sep 01 00:15:00 EDT 2025*
*Session Started: Sunday, August 31, 2025*
*Project Phase: MVP - Post-Property Implementation*

## üèÜ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED
**Property and List models FULLY IMPLEMENTED!**
- Created Property model with 31 fields matching PropertyRadar CSV
- Created List model for import tracking with statistics
- Fixed ALL test infrastructure issues (100% pass rate)
- Analyzed real PropertyRadar CSV files for accuracy
- Added 43 comprehensive test cases

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
Implement PropertyRadar CSV parser and import service - foundation is now complete

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
*None - ready to implement CSV parser*

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)

### HIGH PRIORITY - Import Implementation
1. [ ] Implement PropertyRadar CSV parser (parse 39 columns from CSV)
   - Why: Parse PropertyRadar exports into Property/Contact objects
   - Foundation: Property model complete with 31 fields
   
2. [ ] Create PropertyRadarImportService (handle deduplication, validation)
   - Why: Handle import workflow, scoring, deduplication
   - Foundation: List model complete for tracking
   
3. [ ] Create Property API endpoints (CRUD operations)
   - Why: Frontend needs CRUD operations for properties
   - Foundation: Property model with comprehensive tests

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - MVP Completion
4. [ ] Update Contact model for PropertyRadar fields (optional - basic fields work for MVP)
   - Why: Enhanced contact details from PropertyRadar
   - Status: Basic fields sufficient for MVP launch
   
5. [ ] Build frontend UI for property management and imports
   - Why: User interface for property/import management
   - Foundation: All backend models and tests complete

### LOWER PRIORITY - Additional Features  
6. [ ] Implement remaining Contact API endpoints
   - Why: Contact management still needed
   
7. [ ] Implement Message history API with polling
   - Why: Track sent messages and responses

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### MAJOR MILESTONE: Property Models Implementation (Completed: 00:15 EDT)
- **Achievement**: FULLY implemented Property and List models!
- **Property Model**: 31 fields matching PropertyRadar CSV structure
- **List Model**: Import tracking with statistics and scoring
- **Database**: Migrations created and applied successfully
- **Tests**: 43 comprehensive test cases added (100% pass rate)
- **Analysis**: Verified against real PropertyRadar CSV files
- **Files Created**:
  - `backend/app/models/property.py` - Property model
  - `backend/app/models/list.py` - List model
  - `backend/tests/test_property_models.py` - Property tests
  - `backend/tests/test_list_models.py` - List tests
  - `backend/alembic/versions/66c5792ba0da_*.py` - Migration

### Test Infrastructure Fixes (Completed: 21:55 EDT)
- **Achievement**: Fixed ALL test failures - achieved 100% test pass rate!
- **Starting point**: 217 failures, 106 passing tests
- **Final result**: 0 failures, 323 passing tests (100% pass rate)
- **Improvement**: Added 43 new tests for Property/List models
- **Committed**: Multiple commits culminating in complete implementation

### Gap Analysis Resolution (Completed: 22:10 EDT)
- **Discovery**: Properties were MISSING but CRITICAL for MVP
- **Resolution**: FULLY implemented with comprehensive test coverage
- **Impact**: Can now proceed with PropertyRadar imports
- **Documentation**: Created PROPERTY_MODEL_GAP_ANALYSIS.md

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Status**: Property and List models COMPLETE with 100% test coverage
- **Next**: Implement PropertyRadar CSV parser (39 columns)
- **Critical Path**: CSV Parser ‚Üí Import Service ‚Üí API Endpoints ‚Üí Frontend UI

### Key Decisions This Session
- Property model: 31 fields based on real PropertyRadar CSV analysis
- List model: Tracks imports with statistics and scoring
- Test-first approach: 43 tests written before implementation
- Database design: Efficient indexes for 30,000+ property queries
- Field mapping: Verified against actual PropertyRadar export files

### Files Modified
- `backend/app/models/property.py` - Created Property model (31 fields)
- `backend/app/models/list.py` - Created List model (import tracking)
- `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Added model exports
- `backend/tests/test_property_models.py` - 26 Property tests
- `backend/tests/test_list_models.py` - 17 List tests
- `backend/alembic/versions/66c5792ba0da_*.py` - Database migration
- `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Updated fixtures

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Continue with CSV parser implementation:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2
docker-compose up -d

# Run Property/List tests to verify foundation:
docker-compose exec backend pytest backend/tests/test_property_models.py -xvs
docker-compose exec backend pytest backend/tests/test_list_models.py -xvs

# Check overall test status:
docker-compose exec backend pytest --tb=short
```
