- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing
- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI structure at 85.5% test coverage - identified TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: FIXED critical TDD violation - achieved 100% test pass rate
- 11:47 AM: Implemented test enforcement system to prevent future violations
- 11:47 AM: Enhanced CLAUDE.md to require 100% test pass rate for completion
- 11:58 AM: Todo list updated - confirmed readiness for database work with TDD

- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI structure at 85.5% test coverage - identified TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: FIXED critical TDD violation - achieved 100% test pass rate
- 11:47 AM: Implemented test enforcement system to prevent future violations
- 11:47 AM: Enhanced CLAUDE.md to require 100% test pass rate for completion

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Task (Fix Webhook Tests)
- [ ] All webhook tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [ ] No skipped tests (enforcement requirement)
- [ ] POST /webhooks/openphone endpoint functional
- [ ] Test/implementation compatibility verified
- [ ] Error handling properly tested
- [ ] Mock OpenPhone payload tests working
- [ ] All existing functionality still working (no regressions)

## üìù Session Notes
- 10:05 AM: Docker environment phase represents major milestone - full containerized development ready
- 10:30 AM: v1 analysis showed ngrok caused complexity - v2 will use cleaner webhook approach
- 11:00 AM: All foundation files created, ready for application structure phase
- 11:12 AM: Starting FastAPI application structure - following TDD principles with clean architecture
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI foundation at 85.5% test coverage - identified major TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT - Fixed TDD violation, achieved 100% test pass rate
- 11:47 AM: Implemented automatic test enforcement to prevent future violations
- 11:47 AM: FastAPI foundation truly complete and TDD-compliant - ready for database layer
- 11:58 AM: Status confirmed - ready to proceed with PostgreSQL schema using TDD approach
- 1:00 PM: DATABASE WORK COMPLETE - 168 tests passing, learned critical 100% requirement lesson
- 1:00 PM: Enhanced enforcement prevents both <100% pass rate AND skipped tests
- 1:00 PM: Ready for OpenPhone webhook implementation with complete database foundation
- 1:35 PM: Webhook implementation created but tests failing massively - CRITICAL issue
- 1:38 PM: Must fix tests before any further development - TDD violation occurred

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues
*No active blockers - Docker environment setup complete*

## üîú Next Session Priority
With webhook implementation complete but tests broken:
1. Fix failing webhook tests (CRITICAL - IN PROGRESS)
2. Configure Celery with Redis for async processing
3. Create campaign management API endpoints
4. Implement SMS sending functionality

## üèÜ Major Achievement This Session
**FIXED CRITICAL TDD VIOLATIONS AND COMPLETED DATABASE LAYER**:
- FastAPI Foundation: Fixed 85.5% ‚Üí 100% test pass rate (69 tests)
- Database Layer: Fixed catastrophic failure ‚Üí 100% pass rate (168 tests)
  - Was: 54 failed, 50 errors, 38 skipped tests
  - Now: 168 passing, ZERO errors, ZERO skipped
- Enhanced enforcement prevents both <100% pass rate AND skipped tests
- Learned critical lesson: 96% is NOT acceptable, only 100%
- Database specialist initially tried to declare done at 84% - caught and fixed
- All future development will maintain 100% test compliance with NO skipped tests
