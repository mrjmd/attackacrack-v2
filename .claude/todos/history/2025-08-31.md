- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing
- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI structure at 85.5% test coverage - identified TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: FIXED critical TDD violation - achieved 100% test pass rate
- 11:47 AM: Implemented test enforcement system to prevent future violations
- 11:47 AM: Enhanced CLAUDE.md to require 100% test pass rate for completion
- 11:58 AM: Todo list updated - confirmed readiness for database work with TDD

- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI structure at 85.5% test coverage - identified TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: FIXED critical TDD violation - achieved 100% test pass rate
- 11:47 AM: Implemented test enforcement system to prevent future violations
- 11:47 AM: Enhanced CLAUDE.md to require 100% test pass rate for completion

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Fix test_send_campaign_success Mock/Celery issue
- **File**: /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2/backend/tests/integration/test_campaigns_api.py
- **Line**: 935-947 - Mock assertion failing for send_campaign_messages.delay

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Fix test_send_outside_business_hours_queues - Business hours queueing logic
   - Why: Test expects proper queueing when outside business hours 9am-6pm ET
   - Line: 975-999 in test_campaigns_api.py
   - Issue: Current logic needs refinement for after-hours handling

2. [ ] Fix test_get_campaign_stats - Stats calculation endpoints
   - Why: GET /api/v1/campaigns/{id}/stats endpoint missing or broken
   - Line: 1044-1099 in test_campaigns_api.py
   - Issue: Need to implement stats endpoint with proper calculation logic

3. [ ] Fix test_opted_out_contacts_excluded - Opt-out logic implementation
   - Why: Campaign sending should exclude opted-out contacts
   - Line: 1166-1199 in test_campaigns_api.py
   - Issue: Need opt-out filtering in campaign service send_messages

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Fix test_send_campaign_success Mock/Celery issue
- **File**: /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2/backend/tests/integration/test_campaigns_api.py
- **Line**: 935-947 - Mock assertion failing for send_campaign_messages.delay
- **Problem**: Mock expects send_campaign_messages.delay(campaign.id, test_user.id) but implementation may call differently
- **Solution**: Debug actual task invocation pattern and adjust mock or implementation

### Key Decisions This Session

- 11:47 AM: Enhanced CLAUDE.md to require 100% test pass rate for completion
- 11:58 AM: Todo list updated - confirmed readiness for database work with TDD
- 1:00 PM: Database work COMPLETED - 168 tests passing, ZERO errors, ZERO skipped tests
- 1:00 PM: Critical lesson: 96% is NOT acceptable, only 100% pass rate allowed
- 1:00 PM: Enhanced enforcement to block skipped tests (they're technical debt)
- 1:35 PM: Webhook implementation COMPLETED but tests failing massively
- 1:38 PM: CRITICAL: Implementation exists but test suite broken - immediate fix required
- 9:45 PM: Starting campaign features implementation to fix 4 specific failing tests
- 10:10 PM: MAJOR SUCCESS - 3/4 target tests now passing, core functionality complete
