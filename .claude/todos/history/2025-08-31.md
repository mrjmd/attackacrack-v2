## 📋 PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Initialize FastAPI project structure
   - Why: Need basic app structure before implementing features
   - Depends on: Docker environment (completed)
   
2. [ ] Set up PostgreSQL schema with Alembic
   - Why: Database migrations and schema management
   - Depends on: FastAPI structure
   
3. [ ] Implement OpenPhone webhook receiver with queue
   - Why: Core functionality for receiving SMS
   - Depends on: Database schema
   
4. [ ] Configure Celery with Redis for async processing
   - Why: Background task processing for campaign sending
   - Depends on: Basic app structure

## 🔍 RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Docker environment setup phase complete
- **File**: All Docker configuration files created
- **Problem**: Ready to move to FastAPI application structure
- **Solution**: Use fastapi-implementation agent to create project structure

### Key Decisions This Session
- 10:05 AM: Decided to exclude ngrok from v2 Docker setup (learned from v1 complexity)
- 10:20 AM: Chose Python 3.11 for better async performance
- 10:25 AM: Used multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing

### Files Created/Modified This Session
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main container orchestration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Python 3.11 FastAPI container  
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Node 20 SvelteKit container
- `backend/entrypoint.sh` - FastAPI startup script
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `frontend/package.json` - Node dependencies and scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.env.local` - Local development config
- `.gitignore` - Project exclusions
- `.claude/hooks/persist-todos.sh` - Todo persistence automation

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Start the complete development environment:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running:
docker-compose ps

# View logs if needed:
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```

## 🎯 Definition of Done for Next Task (FastAPI Structure)
- [ ] FastAPI app created with proper structure
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint working
- [ ] Database connection configured
- [ ] Alembic migrations initialized
- [ ] Test structure in place
- [ ] All services accessible via Docker

## 📝 Session Notes
- 10:05 AM: Docker environment phase represents major milestone - full containerized development ready
- 10:30 AM: v1 analysis showed ngrok caused complexity - v2 will use cleaner webhook approach
- 11:00 AM: All foundation files created, ready for application structure phase

## ⚠️ Blockers & Issues
*No active blockers - Docker environment setup complete*

## 🔜 Next Session Priority
After Docker environment verification:
1. Use fastapi-implementation agent to create FastAPI app structure
2. Set up database models and Alembic migrations  
3. Create basic webhook endpoint for OpenPhone
4. Add Celery task configuration

## 📋 PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Initialize FastAPI project structure
   - Why: Need basic app structure before implementing features
   - Depends on: Docker environment (completed)
   
2. [ ] Set up PostgreSQL schema with Alembic
   - Why: Database migrations and schema management
   - Depends on: FastAPI structure
   
3. [ ] Implement OpenPhone webhook receiver with queue
   - Why: Core functionality for receiving SMS
   - Depends on: Database schema
   
4. [ ] Configure Celery with Redis for async processing
   - Why: Background task processing for campaign sending
   - Depends on: Basic app structure

## 🔍 RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Docker environment setup phase complete
- **File**: All Docker configuration files created
- **Problem**: Ready to move to FastAPI application structure
- **Solution**: Use fastapi-implementation agent to create project structure

### Key Decisions This Session
- 10:05 AM: Decided to exclude ngrok from v2 Docker setup (learned from v1 complexity)
- 10:20 AM: Chose Python 3.11 for better async performance
- 10:25 AM: Used multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing

### Files Created/Modified This Session
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main container orchestration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Python 3.11 FastAPI container  
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Node 20 SvelteKit container
- `backend/entrypoint.sh` - FastAPI startup script
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `frontend/package.json` - Node dependencies and scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.env.local` - Local development config
- `.gitignore` - Project exclusions
- `.claude/hooks/persist-todos.sh` - Todo persistence automation

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Start the complete development environment:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running:
docker-compose ps

# View logs if needed:
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```

## 🎯 Definition of Done for Next Task (FastAPI Structure)
- [ ] FastAPI app created with proper structure
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint working
- [ ] Database connection configured
- [ ] Alembic migrations initialized
- [ ] Test structure in place
- [ ] All services accessible via Docker

## 📝 Session Notes
- 10:05 AM: Docker environment phase represents major milestone - full containerized development ready
- 10:30 AM: v1 analysis showed ngrok caused complexity - v2 will use cleaner webhook approach
- 11:00 AM: All foundation files created, ready for application structure phase

## ⚠️ Blockers & Issues
*No active blockers - Docker environment setup complete*

## 🔜 Next Session Priority
After Docker environment verification:
1. Use fastapi-implementation agent to create FastAPI app structure
2. Set up database models and Alembic migrations  
3. Create basic webhook endpoint for OpenPhone
4. Add Celery task configuration
