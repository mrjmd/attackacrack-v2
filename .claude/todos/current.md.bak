## 🔍 RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Fix failing webhook tests
- **File**: backend/tests/test_webhooks.py
- **Line**: Multiple test failures across webhook test suite
- **Problem**: Webhook implementation exists but tests failing massively
- **Solution**: Debug test failures and fix compatibility between tests and implementation

### Key Decisions This Session
- 10:05 AM: Decided to exclude ngrok from v2 Docker setup (learned from v1 complexity)
- 10:20 AM: Chose Python 3.11 for better async performance
- 10:25 AM: Used multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing
- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI structure at 85.5% test coverage - identified TDD violation
- 11:47 AM: FIXED critical TDD violation - achieved 100% test pass rate
- 11:47 AM: Implemented test enforcement system to prevent future violations
- 11:47 AM: Enhanced CLAUDE.md to require 100% test pass rate for completion
- 11:58 AM: Todo list updated - confirmed readiness for database work with TDD
- 1:00 PM: Database work COMPLETED - 168 tests passing, ZERO errors, ZERO skipped tests
- 1:00 PM: Critical lesson: 96% is NOT acceptable, only 100% pass rate allowed
- 1:00 PM: Enhanced enforcement to block skipped tests (they're technical debt)
- 1:35 PM: Webhook implementation COMPLETED but tests failing massively
- 1:38 PM: CRITICAL: Implementation exists but test suite broken - immediate fix required

docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running:
docker-compose ps

# Run full test suite (must be 100%):
docker-compose exec backend pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

*No active blockers - Docker environment setup complete*

## 🔜 Next Session Priority
With webhook implementation complete but tests broken:
1. Fix failing webhook tests (CRITICAL - IN PROGRESS)
2. Configure Celery with Redis for async processing
3. Create campaign management API endpoints
4. Implement SMS sending functionality

## 🏆 Major Achievement This Session
**FIXED CRITICAL TDD VIOLATIONS AND COMPLETED DATABASE LAYER**:
- FastAPI Foundation: Fixed 85.5% → 100% test pass rate (69 tests)
- Database Layer: Fixed catastrophic failure → 100% pass rate (168 tests)
  - Was: 54 failed, 50 errors, 38 skipped tests
  - Now: 168 passing, ZERO errors, ZERO skipped
- Enhanced enforcement prevents both <100% pass rate AND skipped tests
- Learned critical lesson: 96% is NOT acceptable, only 100%
- Database specialist initially tried to declare done at 84% - caught and fixed
- All future development will maintain 100% test compliance with NO skipped tests
