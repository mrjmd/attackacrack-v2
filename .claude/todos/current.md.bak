  - Files: Complete FastAPI application structure with health endpoint
  - Tests: Health endpoint working, configuration system complete, CORS middleware configured
  - Coverage: API versioning implemented, Docker environment fully functional

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Implement OpenPhone webhook receiver with queue
   - Why: Core functionality for receiving SMS
   - Depends on: Database schema
   
3. [ ] Configure Celery with Redis for async processing
   - Why: Background task processing for campaign sending
   - Depends on: Basic app structure

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Set up PostgreSQL schema with Alembic
- **File**: backend/app/models/ and alembic/ directories
- **Problem**: Need database schema, models, and migration system for data persistence
- **Solution**: Set up Alembic migrations, create base models for campaigns, contacts, messages

### Key Decisions This Session
- 10:05 AM: Decided to exclude ngrok from v2 Docker setup (learned from v1 complexity)
- 10:20 AM: Chose Python 3.11 for better async performance
- 10:25 AM: Used multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- 10:45 AM: Included Celery+Redis from start for async task processing
- 11:12 AM: Moving to FastAPI structure phase - using clean architecture with models/services/api separation
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI structure complete with 85.5% test coverage - moving to database schema setup

### Files Created/Modified This Session
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main container orchestration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Python 3.11 FastAPI container  
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Node 20 SvelteKit container
- `backend/entrypoint.sh` - FastAPI startup script
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `frontend/package.json` - Node dependencies and scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.env.local` - Local development config
- `.gitignore` - Project exclusions
- `.claude/hooks/persist-todos.sh` - Todo persistence automation
- `backend/app/` - Complete FastAPI application structure with health endpoint
- `backend/tests/` - Comprehensive test suite (59/69 tests passing)

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Start the complete development environment:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/attackacrack/attackacrack-v2
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running:
docker-compose ps

# View logs if needed:
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Task (PostgreSQL Schema)
- [ ] Alembic initialized with proper configuration
- [ ] Base models created: User, Campaign, Contact, Message, MessageLog
- [ ] Database connection working in FastAPI app
- [ ] Migration files generated and applied
- [ ] Repository pattern implemented for data access
- [ ] Tests for database models and repositories
- [ ] All database operations working via Docker PostgreSQL

## üìù Session Notes
- 10:05 AM: Docker environment phase represents major milestone - full containerized development ready
- 10:30 AM: v1 analysis showed ngrok caused complexity - v2 will use cleaner webhook approach
- 11:00 AM: All foundation files created, ready for application structure phase
- 11:12 AM: Starting FastAPI application structure - following TDD principles with clean architecture
- 11:28 AM: FastAPI foundation complete - 59/69 tests passing, all functional tests working, ready for database layer

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues
*No active blockers - Docker environment setup complete*

## üîú Next Session Priority
After Docker environment verification:
1. Use fastapi-implementation agent to create FastAPI app structure
2. Set up database models and Alembic migrations  
3. Create basic webhook endpoint for OpenPhone
4. Add Celery task configuration
