# Attack-a-Crack v2 - Current Session TODOs
*Last updated: Sun Aug 31 22:38:52 EDT 2025*
*Session Started: Sunday, August 31, 2025*
*Project Phase: MVP - Critical Gap Resolution*

## üö® CRITICAL GAP DISCOVERED
**Properties are MISSING from our implementation but REQUIRED for MVP!**
- PropertyRadar imports need Property model
- 2,500-3,000 contacts/month WITH properties
- Many-to-many relationships essential
- Without this, CSV import cannot work

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
Implement Property models and relationships before continuing with other features

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
*None - ready to start Property implementation*

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)

### CRITICAL - Property Implementation
1. [ ] Create Property model with all fields
   - Why: Core entity for PropertyRadar data (2,500-3,000 records/month)
   
2. [ ] Create ContactPropertyRelationship model
   - Why: Many-to-many relationships between contacts and properties
   
3. [ ] Create List model for import tracking
   - Why: Track PropertyRadar import batches for campaigns
   
4. [ ] Update Contact model for property relationships
   - Why: Contacts need to link to properties
   
5. [ ] Create database migrations for new models
   - Why: Update database schema with property tables

### HIGH - Import Foundation  
6. [ ] Implement PropertyRadar CSV parser
   - Why: Parse 50+ columns from PropertyRadar exports
   
7. [ ] Implement PropertyRadarImportService
   - Why: Handle import, deduplication, validation
   
8. [ ] Create Property API endpoints
   - Why: CRUD operations for properties

### MEDIUM - Complete MVP Features
9. [ ] Implement remaining Contact API endpoints
   - Why: Contact management still needed
   
10. [ ] Implement Message history API with polling
    - Why: Track sent messages and responses
    
11. [ ] Build frontend UI with SvelteKit
    - Why: User interface for all features

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### Test Suite Fixes (Completed: 21:55 EDT)
- **Achievement**: Fixed ALL test failures - achieved 100% test pass rate!
- **Starting point**: 67 failures, 197 passing tests
- **Final result**: 0 failures, 280 passing tests (100% pass rate)
- **Committed**: c69dd97

### Gap Analysis (Completed: 22:10 EDT)
- **Discovery**: Properties are MISSING but CRITICAL for MVP
- **Documentation**: Created PROPERTY_MODEL_GAP_ANALYSIS.md
- **Impact**: Cannot do PropertyRadar imports without Property model

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Status**: Discovered critical gap in Property implementation
- **Next**: Implement Property models using TDD approach
- **Critical Path**: Properties ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Campaigns

### Key Decisions This Session
- Properties are NOT optional - they're core to MVP
- PropertyRadar CSV import is the foundation of the business
- Many-to-many relationships are complex but necessary
- Must handle 30,000+ properties efficiently

## üìù Session Notes
- Test suite complete with 100% pass rate
- Discovered Properties were never implemented
- Planning docs show 2,500-3,000 contacts/month via PropertyRadar
- Each property can have multiple contacts (primary & secondary)
- Properties accumulate to 30,000+ annually
- CSV import cannot work without Property model

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues
**CRITICAL**: No Property model exists despite being essential for:
- PropertyRadar CSV imports
- Contact-property relationships
- Campaign targeting
- Job tracking

## üîú Next Actions (Immediate)
1. Create Property model with TDD
2. Create relationship models
3. Update Contact model
4. Create migrations
5. Implement CSV parser
6. Build import service

## üèÜ Major Achievement This Session
**100% TEST PASS RATE ACHIEVED**
- All 280 tests passing
- System ready for new feature development
- Discovered and documented critical Property gap
