## üîë Key Process Insights

### The Discovery Conversation Method Works!
Through iterative Q&A with QuickBooks, we discovered:
- Quote follow-up texts sent within 5 minutes (automation opportunity)
- Pricing is art not science (but has patterns)
- Payment tracking is "all in my head" (major pain)
- QuickBooks replacement is long-term goal
- Forgotten invoices for remote payments (builders)

**This would never have emerged from just writing specs!**

## üìù User's Parting Wisdom
*"The exercise we are supposed to be involved in right now is an in-depth conversational iterative process led by you to make sure that we suss out all of the requirements... I'm actually learning more about my own ideas and requirements through the conversation, so it's really vital."*
