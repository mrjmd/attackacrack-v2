# Gmail Integration Requirements - Multi-Channel Communication Hub

## Vision
Transform Gmail from a cluttered inbox into a smart, surgical tool that surfaces only what matters, while seamlessly connecting email threads to customer records and enabling automated email workflows.

## Current Gmail Usage

### System of Record For:
1. **Customer Interactions**
   - Quote discussions
   - Photo submissions
   - Formal communications
   - Contract/agreement exchanges

2. **Vendor Management**
   - Material orders
   - Supplier communications
   - Delivery scheduling
   - Invoice management

3. **Professional Services**
   - Accountant communications
   - Legal correspondence
   - Insurance renewals
   - Compliance documentation

4. **Future: Email Marketing Responses**
   - Campaign replies (via SmartLead)
   - Newsletter feedback
   - Customer inquiries from marketing

## Critical Pain Points

### 1. Poor Email Categorization
**Problem**: Gmail's default categorization insufficient
- Important emails buried in noise
- Distractions overwhelming important items
- Manual sorting takes too much time

**Solution Needed**: Smart filtering that understands business context

### 2. Disconnected from Customer Records
**Problem**: Email threads exist in isolation
- Photos sent via email not accessible in OpenPhone workflow
- No link between email conversations and CRM records
- Manual copying between systems

**Solution Needed**: Unified conversation view across channels

### 3. Multi-Channel Conversation Chaos
**Problem**: Conversations jump between email/text/phone
- Customer starts in email, you move them to text
- Hard to track full conversation history
- High cognitive load maintaining context

**Solution Needed**: Single threaded view regardless of channel

## Smart Email Prioritization System

### Intelligent Filtering
```python
class EmailPrioritizer:
    def analyze_email(self, email):
        priority_score = 0
        
        # Critical business emails
        if "quote approved" in email.subject.lower():
            priority_score = 100  # URGENT
        
        if email.from_address in customer_database:
            priority_score += 50  # Customer email
            
        if email.from_address in vendor_database:
            if contains_renewal_keywords(email):
                priority_score = 90  # Insurance renewal, etc.
            else:
                priority_score += 30
                
        if is_quickbooks_email(email):
            priority_score += 40
            
        # Noise reduction
        if is_marketing_email(email):
            priority_score -= 50
        if is_automated_notification(email):
            priority_score -= 30
            
        return {
            "priority": priority_score,
            "category": determine_category(email),
            "action_required": detect_action_items(email)
        }
```
