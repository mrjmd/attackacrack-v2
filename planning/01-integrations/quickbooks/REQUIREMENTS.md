# QuickBooks Integration Requirements - Attack-a-Crack v2

## Vision
QuickBooks integration ensures every quote approval is captured instantly, invoices are ready before jobs begin, and financial data flows seamlessly between systems - turning "money waiting" into "money collected."

## Critical Business Value
**"Quote approvals are money waiting to be scheduled"** - This integration directly impacts revenue by surfacing approvals instantly and streamlining the quote-to-cash cycle.

## Core Integration Points

### 1. Quote Management

#### Quote Creation Flow
**From CRM ‚Üí QuickBooks:**
```
1. Create quote in CRM with:
   - Customer info
   - Line items (crack repair, waterproofing, etc.)
   - Photos attached
   - Job notes
   
2. Push to QuickBooks:
   - Create/match customer
   - Add line items with descriptions
   - Set expiration (30 days default)
   - Include CRM reference ID
   
3. QuickBooks sends quote to customer
4. Track status in both systems
```

#### Quote Approval Detection üö® CRITICAL
**The Money Waiting Alert:**

**Current Problem:** Quote approvals arrive via email and get lost

**Solution:**
1. **Email Monitoring:**
   - Watch for QuickBooks approval emails
   - Parse customer and amount
   - Create TOP PRIORITY todo
   - Dashboard alert with üí∞ icon
   - Push notification to phone

2. **API Polling (Backup):**
   - Check quote status every 15 minutes
   - Compare against last known state
   - Trigger alerts on status change

**Dashboard Display:**
```
üí∞ MONEY WAITING - QUOTES APPROVED (2)
‚ö†Ô∏è Johnson - $4,500 approved 2 days ago [SCHEDULE NOW]
‚ö†Ô∏è Martinez - $2,800 approved 4 hours ago [SCHEDULE NOW]

üö® UNPAID JOBS (3)
‚ö†Ô∏è Smith - Completed 3 days ago - $3,200 [SEND INVOICE]
‚ö†Ô∏è Davis - Completed 2 days ago - $1,800 [CHECK PAYMENT]

üìä OPEN ESTIMATES (5) - $47,000 total
Oldest: Wilson - 8 days old [FOLLOW UP]
```

### 2. Customer Synchronization

#### Two-Way Sync Strategy
**CRM ‚Üí QuickBooks:**
- New contacts from OpenPhone
- Updated phone numbers
- Address changes
- Email additions

**QuickBooks ‚Üí CRM:**
- Payment history
- Credit status
- Total lifetime value
- Outstanding balances

#### Matching Logic
```python
def match_customer(crm_contact, qb_customers):
    # Priority order for matching:
    # 1. Phone number (normalized)
    # 2. Email address
    # 3. Name + partial address
    # 4. Create new if no match
```

### 3. Invoice Automation

#### Morning Invoice Generation (6 AM Daily)

   - Find associated quote in QuickBooks
   - Convert quote ‚Üí invoice
   - Add job date and technician
   - Set payment terms (due on completion)
3. Update dashboard:
   "‚úÖ 3 invoices ready for today's jobs"
4. Notify technician via SMS
```

**Benefits:**
- Invoices ready when tech arrives
- No forgotten billing
- Faster payment collection
- Consistent pricing from quote

#### Post-Job Invoice Handling
**Completion Flow:**
1. Job marked complete (Calendar + Invoice exists)
