# [Integration Name] Integration - Deep Discovery Document

## Executive Summary
[Brief description of the integration and its business value]

## Current State (v1)
[How is this handled in v1? What are the problems?]

## Vision & Dream State
[What would perfect look like? How would this transform the business?]

## Business Value Proposition

### Immediate Value (MVP)
- [Specific, measurable benefit 1]
- [Specific, measurable benefit 2]
- [Specific, measurable benefit 3]

### Future Value (Post-MVP)
- [Long-term benefit 1]
- [Long-term benefit 2]
- [Strategic advantage]

## User Journey Mapping

### Primary User Flow
```
1. User Action: [What triggers this integration?]
   ↓
2. System Response: [What happens immediately?]
   ↓
3. Integration Point: [Where does external service come in?]
   ↓
4. Data Processing: [What do we do with the data?]
   ↓
5. User Feedback: [What does user see/experience?]
   ↓
6. Business Outcome: [What value was created?]
```

### Alternative Flows
- **Error Case**: [What if service is down?]
- **Partial Data**: [What if we get incomplete response?]
- **Rate Limited**: [How do we handle throttling?]

## Technical Requirements

### API Capabilities
- **Authentication Method**: [OAuth, API Key, etc.]
- **Rate Limits**: [Requests per second/minute/hour]
- **Data Formats**: [JSON, XML, etc.]
- **Real-time vs Batch**: [Webhook, polling, batch sync]
- **Reliability**: [SLA, uptime history]

### Data Model Mapping

#### Their Data Structure
```json
{
  // Example of their API response
}
```

#### Our Data Structure
```python
class OurModel:
    # How we'll store this data
    pass
```

#### Transformation Logic
- Field mappings
- Data enrichment
- Validation rules
- Default values

## Integration Architecture

### Sync Strategy
- [ ] Real-time (webhooks)
- [ ] Near real-time (polling)
- [ ] Batch (scheduled sync)
- [ ] On-demand (user triggered)
- [ ] Hybrid (mix of above)

### Data Flow Diagram
```
External Service → Our System → User Interface
       ↓               ↓            ↓
    Webhooks      Processing    Display
       ↓               ↓            ↓
    API Calls     Enrichment    Actions
       ↓               ↓            ↓
     Cache         Storage      Triggers
```

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Retry Logic**: [Exponential backoff? Max retries?]
2. **Fallback Behavior**: [Cache? Default values?]
3. **User Notification**: [How do we inform about failures?]
4. **Recovery Process**: [How to sync missed data?]

## UI/UX Design

### Configuration Interface
- What settings does user need to provide?
- How do we validate credentials?
- What options should be configurable?

### Data Display
- Where does integrated data appear?
- How is it differentiated from local data?
- What actions can user take on integrated data?

### Status & Monitoring
- How does user know integration is working?
- Where can they see sync history?
- How are errors displayed?
