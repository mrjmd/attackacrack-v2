# Attack-a-Crack v2 Planning - Session Handoff Document

*Last Updated: December 30, 2024 - Afternoon Session*
*Purpose: Continue exactly where we left off*

## 🎯 Current Status: Planning ~90% Complete, Ready for Implementation Soon

We've completed most planning through conversational discovery. The key remaining item is finalizing the TDD Test Suite Design after discussing the research findings. We're almost ready to start building!

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Start Next Session Here

### TDD Test Suite Design Discussion Needed
**We have a DRAFT document with research findings that must be discussed before finalizing.**

The research revealed major industry shifts:
- **JSDOM is dead** - Real browser testing is now standard
- **AI assistants lie** - 5-30% false positive rate without browser validation  
- **Contract testing is essential** - For decoupled FastAPI/SvelteKit architecture
- **Screenshot proof required** - Claude must show browser evidence

**Next session MUST start with:**
1. Review research findings on modern TDD practices
2. Discuss trade-offs (browser testing slower but accurate)
3. Decide enforcement gates for Claude
4. Finalize coverage requirements
5. Convert DRAFT to final design

## ✅ Completed Planning (This Session)

### Critical Business Correction
- **Fixed**: Removed all "roofing" references 
- **Correct**: Concrete/foundation repair business
- **Lesson**: Never assume, always verify through conversation

### Contacts, Properties & Jobs Architecture
- **Many-to-many relationships** fully mapped
- **Jobs as automatic containers** (created on quote/assessment)
- **Lists as first-class entities** for campaign tracking
- **Monthly PropertyRadar imports** accumulate (2,500-3,000/month)

### Infrastructure Decisions
- **Keep DigitalOcean** - Don't fix what isn't broken
- **Skip Supabase** - Unnecessary complexity
- **Add staging environment** - $22/month for safety
- **Use Spaces for storage** - $5/month vs Supabase complexity

### Documentation Completed
- Gemini integration (consolidated from scattered docs)
- Contacts/Properties/Jobs requirements
- Navigation & Information Architecture  
- Hosting & Deployment Strategy
- SmartLead future state
- TDD Test Suite Design (DRAFT)

## 🔴 Remaining Planning (~10%)

### Must Complete (Priority Order)
1. **TDD Test Suite Design** - Discuss research, finalize from draft
2. **MVP Definition Update** - Incorporate all clarifications
3. **Architecture Gap Analysis** - Verify everything connects
4. **Integration Audit** - Ensure all as complete as Gemini

### Ready for Implementation
Once above complete, we can start building MVP!

## 💡 Key Insights from Today

### The Conversation Method Works
**Quote**: "I'm actually learning more about my own ideas and requirements through the conversation"

This session proved it - we discovered:
- Wrong business domain in docs (roofing vs concrete)
- Complex many-to-many relationships
- Jobs should be automatic, not manual
- Lists needed for campaign attribution

### Browser Testing is Non-Negotiable
Research shows AI coding assistants have high false positive rates. The solution:
- Mandatory browser testing
- Screenshot evidence required
- Cannot claim "done" without proof
- Vitest Browser Mode + Playwright

### Keep Infrastructure Simple
- V1's DigitalOcean setup works fine
- Environment variables already configured (painful but done)
- Just add staging for safety
- Don't add Supabase complexity

## 🚀 Ready to Continue

### Option A: Complete Planning (Recommended)
1. **Discuss TDD research findings**
   - Browser testing vs JSDOM
   - Contract testing approach
   - Claude enforcement gates
   - Coverage requirements

2. **Finalize remaining docs**
   - Convert TDD draft to final
   - Update MVP definition
   - Quick gap analysis

3. **Begin implementation**
   - Set up development environment
   - Create first failing test
   - Start TDD cycle

### Option B: Start Implementation Now
If you feel planning is sufficient:
- Accept TDD draft as-is
- Begin FastAPI project setup
- Implement with learning as we go

## 🎯 Success Metrics for V2

### What We're Building Toward
- **Zero "it works" lies** - Browser validation required
- **90% less code than v1** - Simplicity over complexity
- **PropertyRadar CSV import working** - Core business need
- **Campaigns that actually send** - Revenue generation
- **Browser tests for everything** - Trust but verify

## 📝 Critical Context for Next Session

### User's Stated Needs
- **Mandatory browser validation** - No more false positives
- **2,500-3,000 PropertyRadar contacts/month** - For campaigns
- **Jobs auto-created** - No manual work
- **Many-to-many relationships** - Complex but necessary
- **Keep infrastructure simple** - V1 setup works

### Process Requirements
- **Discussion before documentation** - No jumping ahead
- **Iterative discovery** - Learn through conversation
- **DRAFT for complex topics** - Discuss before finalizing
- **Research-backed decisions** - Evidence over assumptions

## 🔄 Session Continuation Checklist

When starting next session:
- [ ] Read this handoff document first
- [ ] Open TDD_TEST_SUITE_DESIGN_DRAFT.md
- [ ] Present research findings to user
- [ ] Discuss trade-offs and decisions
- [ ] Convert draft to final through conversation
- [ ] Update MVP definition with clarifications
- [ ] Perform quick gap analysis
- [ ] Determine if ready to start implementation

## Critical Reminders

### MUST DO
- ✅ Discuss TDD research before finalizing
- ✅ Browser testing with real browsers
- ✅ Screenshot evidence from Claude
- ✅ Contract testing for API

### MUST NOT DO
- ❌ Write documentation without discussion
- ❌ Trust AI without browser proof
- ❌ Add unnecessary complexity (Supabase)
- ❌ Change working infrastructure

## 🔥 The Most Important Discovery

**Browser-based testing with mandatory screenshot evidence is the only way to prevent AI coding assistants from false "it works" claims.**

The research is clear: 
- Vitest Browser Mode replaces JSDOM
- Playwright for E2E validation
- Screenshots required as proof
- Contract testing for decoupled architecture

*Next session should take ~30 minutes to finalize planning, then we're ready to start building with TDD from day one!*
