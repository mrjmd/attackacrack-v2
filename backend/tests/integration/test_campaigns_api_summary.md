#### 2. GET /api/v1/campaigns/{id} - Get Campaign Details (4 tests)
- ✅ Successful retrieval
- ✅ Not found handling (404)
- ✅ User isolation (can't access other user's campaigns)

#### 3. POST /api/v1/campaigns - Create Campaign (5 tests)
- ✅ Successful creation with full data
- ✅ Minimal required fields
- ✅ A/B testing support
- ✅ Comprehensive validation (name, template, limits)
- ✅ Authentication requirements

#### 4. PUT /api/v1/campaigns/{id} - Update Campaign (3 tests)
- ✅ Full update success
- ✅ Partial updates
- ✅ Active campaign restrictions (can't modify templates)

#### 5. DELETE /api/v1/campaigns/{id} - Delete Campaign (3 tests)
- ✅ Successful deletion
- ✅ Active campaign protection
- ✅ Cascade deletion of messages

#### 6. Campaign Contacts Management (4 tests)
- ✅ Add contacts via JSON
- ✅ Duplicate contact prevention
- ✅ List campaign contacts
- ✅ CSV import (5000 rows in <5s performance requirement)

#### 7. Campaign Sending (4 tests)
- ✅ Trigger sending (async with Celery)
- ✅ Draft campaign restrictions
- ✅ Business hours enforcement (9am-6pm ET)
- ✅ Daily limit enforcement (125 messages/day)

#### 8. Campaign Statistics (2 tests)
- ✅ Detailed stats (sent, delivered, failed, rates)
- ✅ Empty campaign stats

#### 9. Business Logic (3 tests)
- ✅ Business hours compliance
- ✅ Opted-out contact exclusion
- ✅ A/B testing distribution

#### 10. Performance Tests (2 tests)
- ✅ List campaigns <200ms
- ✅ CSV import <5s for 5000 rows

## Key Features Tested:

### Campaign Management
- CRUD operations with proper validation
- Status workflow (draft → active → completed)
- User isolation and security
- Database relationship handling

### Rate Limiting & Compliance
- Daily sending limits (125 messages default)
- Business hours enforcement (9am-6pm ET)
- Opt-out compliance
- Duplicate contact prevention

### A/B Testing
- Template variants (A/B)
- Percentage distribution
- Statistical tracking

### Performance Requirements
- API response times <200ms
- Bulk operations (CSV import) <5s
- Pagination for large datasets

### Integration Points
- Celery task queuing for async sending
- Database transactions and rollbacks
- Authentication and authorization
- File upload handling (CSV)

## Test Results (RED Phase - Expected Failures):
```
33 FAILED, 4 PASSED
```

All tests are properly failing because:
1. No API routes exist yet
2. No service layer implemented
3. No authentication system
4. No Celery integration

## Next Steps for GREEN Phase:
1. Implement FastAPI routes
2. Create service layer for business logic
3. Add authentication middleware
4. Integrate Celery for async tasks
5. Add CSV processing capabilities

## Test Quality Indicators:
- ✅ Comprehensive validation testing
- ✅ Error condition coverage
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Security requirements
- ✅ Real-world usage patterns
- ✅ Edge case handling

These tests define the complete API contract and expected behavior for the campaign management system.
