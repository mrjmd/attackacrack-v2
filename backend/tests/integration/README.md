# OpenPhone Webhook Integration Tests

## Overview

Comprehensive integration tests for OpenPhone webhook processing with queue system.

**Total Tests Created**: 41 webhook integration tests  
**Current Project Total**: 209 tests (168 existing + 41 new)  
**All Tests Status**: RED phase ✅ (failing as expected in TDD)

## Test Coverage

### 1. Webhook Endpoint Tests (`test_webhook_endpoint.py`) - 10 tests
- ✅ Endpoint exists at `/api/v1/webhooks/openphone`
- ✅ Valid webhooks return 200 OK quickly (<100ms)
- ✅ Invalid signatures rejected with 400
- ✅ Missing signatures rejected with 400  
- ✅ Different event types accepted
- ✅ Malformed JSON returns 422
- ✅ WebhookEvent records created in database
- ✅ Duplicate webhooks handled gracefully
- ✅ Performance under concurrent load
- ✅ Celery queue failures return 500

### 2. Webhook Security Tests (`test_webhook_security.py`) - 10 tests
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- ✅ Different JSON formatting signatures work
- ✅ Timestamp validation prevents replay attacks
- ✅ Recent timestamps accepted
- ✅ Missing timestamps handled gracefully
- ✅ Various signature header formats
- ✅ Special characters in payload signatures
- ✅ Rate limiting considerations
- ✅ Content-Type validation (application/json required)
- ✅ Webhook secrets never logged/exposed

### 3. Queue Processing Tests (`test_webhook_queue.py`) - 11 tests
- ✅ Webhooks queue to Celery immediately
- ✅ Exact payload preservation in queue
- ✅ Celery task processes webhooks
- ✅ Different event types routed to correct handlers
- ✅ Failed tasks retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Max retries exceeded handling
- ✅ WebhookEvent marked processed on success
- ✅ WebhookEvent marked failed on persistent errors
- ✅ Duplicate message handling in queue
- ✅ Appropriate logging during processing

### 4. Event Processing Tests (`test_webhook_events.py`) - 10 tests
- ✅ message.received creates WebhookEvent record
- ✅ New contacts created from phone numbers
- ✅ Existing contacts found and updated
- ✅ Message records created with correct status
- ✅ Duplicate messages handled gracefully
- ✅ message.delivered updates message status
- ✅ call.completed creates call records
- ✅ voicemail.received creates voicemail messages
- ✅ Unknown event types handled gracefully
- ✅ Malformed webhook data handled safely

## Test Fixtures & Utilities

### OpenPhone Payload Examples (`fixtures/openphone_payloads.py`)
- ✅ Realistic webhook payloads for all event types
- ✅ Common test scenarios (new customer, followup, urgent calls)
- ✅ Invalid payload examples for error testing
- ✅ Helper methods for generating test data

### Test Configuration (`conftest.py` additions)
- ✅ Webhook signature generation utilities
- ✅ WebhookTester helper for easy testing
- ✅ OpenPhone payload fixtures

## Key Requirements Tested

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ Webhook response time <100ms
- ✅ Concurrent webhook handling
- ✅ Queue processing performance

### Security Requirements
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- ✅ Replay attack prevention (timestamp validation)
- ✅ Secret key protection
- ✅ Content-Type validation

### Reliability Requirements
- ✅ Celery queue integration
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Dead letter queue for failed processing
- ✅ Graceful error handling

### Data Integrity Requirements
- ✅ Exact payload preservation
- ✅ Database transaction handling
- ✅ Duplicate detection and prevention
- ✅ Event tracking and status updates

## TDD Compliance

✅ **RED Phase Complete**: All 41 tests fail as expected  
⏳ **GREEN Phase**: Next step - implement webhook endpoint  
⏳ **REFACTOR Phase**: Clean up implementation after tests pass

## Implementation Dependencies

The failing tests indicate these components need implementation:

1. **API Endpoint**: `/api/v1/webhooks/openphone` POST handler
2. **Signature Service**: `app.services.openphone.verify_webhook_signature`
3. **Celery Worker**: `app.worker.process_openphone_webhook` task
4. **Event Processors**: `app.services.webhook.process_*` handlers
5. **Configuration**: Webhook secrets and settings

## Next Steps

1. Implement webhook endpoint handler
2. Create OpenPhone signature verification service
3. Set up Celery worker tasks
4. Implement event processing services
5. Add configuration management
6. Run tests to achieve GREEN phase
7. Browser validation with Playwright
